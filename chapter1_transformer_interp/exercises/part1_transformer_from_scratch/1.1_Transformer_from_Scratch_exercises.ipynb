        "We need to define a standard way of splitting up language into a series of substrings, where each substring is a member of our **vocabulary** set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Could we use a dictionary, and have our vocabulary be the set of all words in the dictionary? No, because this couldn't handle arbitrary text (e.g. URLs, punctuation, etc). We need a more general way of splitting up language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Could we just use the 256 ASCII characters? This fixes the previous problem, but it loses structure of language - some sequences of characters are more meaningful than others. For example, \"language\" is a lot more meaningful than \"hjksdfiu\". We want \"language\" to be a single token, but not \"hjksdfiu\" - this is a more efficient use of our vocab.\n",
        "\n",
        "What actually happens? The most common strategy is called **Byte-Pair encodings**.\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin with the 256 ASCII characters as our tokens, and then find the most common pair of tokens, and merge that into a new token. Note that we do have a space character as one of our 256 tokens, and merges using space are very common. For instance, here are the five first merges for the tokenizer used by GPT-2 (you'll be able to verify this below).\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note - you might see the character `Ġ` in front of some tokens. This is a special token that indicates that the token begins with a space. Tokens with a leading space vs not are different.\n",

For instance, in the sentence `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`, the names in this sentence are the most important tokens for predicting that the final token will be `\"Mary\"`, and this is because of the particular context of this sentence rather than the tokens' position.\n",

This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem principled at first.

If our model had no attention heads or MLP layers, then all we have is a linear map from our one-hot encoded token `T` to a probability distribution over the token following `T`. This map is represented by the linear transformation $t \\to t^T W_E W_U$ (where $t$ is our one-hot encoded token vector). Since the output of this transformation can only be a function of the token `T` (and no earlier tokens), the best we can do is have this map approximate the true frequency of bigrams starting with `T`, which appear in the training data. Importantly, **this is not a symmetric map**. We want `T = \"Barack\"` to result in a high probability of the next token being `\"Obama\"`, but not the other way around!\n",
        "\n",
        "Even in multi-layer models, a similar principle applies. There will be more paths through the model than just the \"direct path\" $W_E W_U$, but because of the residual connections there will always exist a direct path, so there will always be some incentive for $W_E W_U$ to approximate bigram frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "That being said, smaller (<8B parameter) LLMs still often use tied embeddings to improve training and inference efficiency. It can be easier to start from tied weights and then use MLP0 to break the symmetry than to initialize encoder and decoder with no shared structure at all.\n",

        "\n",
        "If you did the material on [training loops](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#training-loop) during the first week, this should all be familiar to you. If not, you can skim that section for an overview of the key concepts. The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:\n",
        "                \n",
        "* The key parts of a gradient update step are:\n",
        "    * Calculating the (cross-entropy) loss between a model's output and the true labels,\n",
        "    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,\n",
        "    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.\n",
        "* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
        "* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!\n",
        "    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.\n",
        "* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:\n",
        "    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).\n",
        "    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{\"loss\": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.\n",
        "    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments)."

You can terminate each training phase after this many steps. It's set to a default value that should lead to a very short run demonstrating nontrivial model performance.\n",
        "* Remember to move tokens to your device, via `tokens.to(device)` (this should be a global variable, defined at the top of your notebook).\n",

        "Note how after each \"generate\" stage, we have `num_beams ** 2` possible completions, which we then filter down to `num_beams`. This is because we need this many in order to find the best `num_beams` completions overall - for example, it's possible that all the best beams of length `n+1` come from the same beam of length `n`, in which case we'll need to keep all `num_beams` that we generated from that single beam.\n",

Our algorithm terminates when either all our sequences have length `max_new_tokens` larger than the initial prompt length, or we've generated `num_returns_sequences` terminating sequences."

        "We've given you one implementation of `beam_search` below, which calls the `generate` and `filter` methods of the `Beams` class (these correspond to the two stages in the diagram above). The `beam_search` method works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a list `final_logprobs_and_completions` for storing the final output, as tuples of (logprob sum, string completion).\n",
        "- Perform `max_new_tokens` steps of generation (producing a new set of beams) and filtering (getting the best beams from these combinations), while also adding terminated beams to the list of best beams\n",
        "- Return these terminated beams plus the best ones we have at the end of the steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "So all you need to do is fill in the `generate` and `filter` methods. Below, you'll find some unit tests for the `generate` and `filter` methods. When you've passed these tests, you should be able to run the full `beam_search` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important note** - by default, beam search produces a lot of repeated words / phrases / sentences. This makes sense - if the model finds some completion with a much higher logit sum than most completions in its beam search space, then it will want to repeat this completion even if it doesn't make a lot of sense in context. A common solution is to ban repetition of n-grams, which you should also implement in the function below. In other words, rather than sampling tokens from each sequence by taking `logprobs.topk(k)` in your `generate` method, you should take the `k` top tokens after filtering out those that give you repeated n-grams of length `no_repeat_ngram_size`. Good values of this parameter to try are 2 or 3 (although we recommend you try without this parameter first, so you can see how much of a difference it makes!)."
